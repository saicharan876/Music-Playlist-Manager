The evolution of digital music pla orms has brought about a need for efficient 
music playlist management systems. Managing a music playlist involves adding 
new songs, removing unwanted tracks, shuffling, and organizing songs in 
various ways. This project addresses these needs by implemen ng a Music 
Playlist Manager in C++, u lizing a singly linked list as the core data structure. 
The program is a console-based menu-driven applica on that offers a variety 
of features to manage a playlist effec vely. It provides a prac cal example of 
how linked lists can be used to store and manipulate sequen al data 
dynamically. 
The project combines theore cal knowledge of linked lists with prac cal 
programming skills, offering users a lightweight, func onal tool for playlist 
management.
